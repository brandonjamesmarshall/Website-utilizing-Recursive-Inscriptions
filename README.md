# Website utilizing recursive inscriptions

Provided here is a template that you can use to inscribe your own single-page HTML website.

This can be used as a landing page, digital business card, quick bio, whatever!

## Quick instructions:
1. Inscribe a photo of yourself (or find a photo you want to use) and make note of its Inscription ID
2. Edit template.html and modify with your own information.
3. Use a minify service such as https://www.willpeavy.com/tools/minifier/ to remove all the comments and extra white space. This will result in the smallest file size possible!
3. Inscribe template.html using an inscription service such as OrdinalsBot. Use my ref code if you like: https://ordinalsbot.com?ref=brandonmarshall


## Some additional notes for how I made this:
### > original-files/brandonmarshall-max.html was used for internal testing to build out the site

Once I verified everything was working on that level, I inscribed all the assets (WEBP and SVGs) and took note of each of their Inscription IDs.

From there, I created a new doc and replaced the static files with using /source/INSCRIPTIONID

I also minified the HTML file, which isn't required but removed unnecessary blank space to cut down on the file size and make it even cheaper to inscribe.

### > The actual HTML file I originally inscribed is in original-files/brandonmarshal.html
